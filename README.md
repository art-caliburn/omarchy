# Omarchy

This is my own personal repo for my omarchy installation. Changes found here are specifically for my PC only, including monitors.conf as well as my personal dotfiles. Heavy testing was done on which packages could be safely removed to 'debloat' the omarchy install. If you do use this for your own install please make sure to edit the files in /config/ (specifically monitors.conf) otherwise you will run into issues.
